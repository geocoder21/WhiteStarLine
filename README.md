# White Star Line Iceberg Analysis
 
## Description
This project assesses whether an area of sea contains icebergs.  Where icebergs are found, it calculates volume and mass of ice. 
The aim is to identify icebergs that are small enough to be towed out of the way of shipping using a specialised iceberg-towing tug vessel.  

## Installation

## Usage
The programme requires radar and lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) data for a 300m by 300m grid. 
- Radar values of 100 or greater indicate ice
- Lidar values represent height of ice, with 10 units per metre
Example data sources are included within the code.  These could be updated, but the programme would require the same parameters within the new data.
